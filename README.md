# Making Games is fun
A small visual novel I created for an english writing project in college. The project in question required me to pick a topic and a target audence. The topic that I decided to write about
was why kids should learn how to make video games. I created this visual novel in conjunction with my project because I felt the best way to showcase to kids why making games is fun was
to create a video game showcasing that.
